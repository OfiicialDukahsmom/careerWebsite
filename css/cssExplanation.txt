- @media
This right here? Yeah basically I can just say if it's a certain window size like 1200 pixels,
the style will change depending on if 1200 pixels is the max or minimum width, it's pretty easy to understand.


- @Keyframes
These kinda just rely off the animation style property so for example,
one of my properties were "animation: tickerSlide 15s linear infinite;" the animation is called
tickerSlide, its duration is 15 seconds, the movement type is linear, meaning it moving at a
consistent pace, and the last one is how much times it does it which is infinite soo yeah

The actual @keyframes is kind of like @media not really but here let me elaborate,
so if the animation duration is at 0% we can use this little property called "transform: translateX(0)"
it translates across the X axis obviously and I have no clue why it's called transform but that's the
term that's used for it so I'm not gonna complain that much, yeah but when it's 100%, the end result will be
transform: translateX(-50%), and this is where @keyframes does its magic as @keyframes makes it so it slowly
translates the X axis from 0 to -50%, and it will continue doing this forever due to me setting how many times
the animation will repeat to be infinite

Code Source for Keyframes Explanation:

.tickerAnimate {
  animation: tickerSlide 35s linear infinite;
}


@keyframes tickerSlide {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }

  100% {
    transform: translateX(-90%);
  }
}
